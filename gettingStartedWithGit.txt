getting started with git

if you don't have a github account, create one
contact stanley to get pushing privileges for the repo

download git
go to your cli: command prompt for windows | terminal for mac
navigate to the directory you want the project to be in
	mine is "c:\users\me\" for example
	you navigate in a cli typically by using the command `cd`. if you're not familiar with it, a quick google search should clarify it, but basically it stands for "change directory" and it changes the directory you're in in the cli
		example `cd c:\` will bring you to the c:\ directory; which most computers have
		`cd c:\users\me\` will bring me to my `me` directory, where i keep the club's website project
type `git clone https://github.com/SBUWebAndAppClub/ClubWebsite.git`
	afterwards, you can type the command `dir` to see all your files in the current directory, if you see ClubWebsite, you know it worked
	*on mac the command is `ls` not `dir`
change to the ClubWebsite directory
now, open this file on your computer -- it's in your ClubWebsite folder because this file is part of the repo you just cloned
make some changes to this file -- anything you think i left out, or will make it easier for future readers
go back to the cli
type git status
you should see this file in red
	this means git knows you made changes to it
type `git add gettingStartedWithGit.txt`
type `git commit -m"within these quotation marks put a message that describes the changes you made"`
type `git push`
	it will ask you for your username and password
refresh the github page you're using to look at this file in the browser
if you see your changes, congratulations, you've successfully pushed changes to the club's repo
next step -- create a website
